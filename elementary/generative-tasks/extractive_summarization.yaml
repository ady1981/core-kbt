task: extractive_summarization
description:
  same_as:
    - An elementary LLM generative task focused on extracting the most salient sentences or phrases directly from the input content to form a summary, without paraphrasing or generating new text.
    - Generates a summary by selecting the most important sentences or phrases directly from the input content.
